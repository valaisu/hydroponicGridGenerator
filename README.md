# hydroponicGridGenerator

I have created this system for hydroponically growing plants in my aquarium. 

(insert a picture of the aquarium)

I really like the design, but modelling the stl files by hand, one by one, was quite time consuming and I did not 
always get the measures right the first time. So in case I or someone else wants to replicate this project, 
I have decided to create a script for generating all the necessary stl files all at once.

## The base implementation

The user gives width and length of their equivalnt of aquarium, along with some other parameters. This will be significantly clearer once I add pictures showcasing the features the parameters affect.

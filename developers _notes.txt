The purpose of this file is to gather my miscellaneous thoughts that
might some day benefit someone


My printer is Prusa mk4, with a .40 mm nozzle. The files have been created 
to work on my printer. For example the edges will be exactly 2 layers thick, 
which in my opinion is desirable. 
I have generated my print files using Prusa slicers mode "20mm, Speed". This
might be especially important with the "build up" pieces, as this print
setting creates some visible imperfections, in turn making the tolerances 
perfect for me specifically
Also the connectors work pretty much perfectly on my machine print settings. 


Printing the "build up" pieces has surprisingly had some minor stability
issues, not seen with any other parts. Probably something to do with the
overhang


The margins are a bit of a mystery for me. I have to test them once I
have the feature "generate test print". But even then, it might be correct
only for my printer


Custom plant holder
If you know your way around blender a bit, you can edit Modular_platform.blend
to make the hole custom shaped. However, note that the file has vertices
belonging to vertex groups. Be careful to not touch those vertices!


The base files in models 4.0 have been generated with blender 4.0.0.
If one uses 4.2.2, the code should work but you probably will get a 
lot of "warnings" and really small memory leaks. For what I have tested,
these complications seem innocuous.
